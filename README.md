## My process

### Workflow

- Write HTML first to create the structure that will be built upon.
- Style from lowest specificity to highest specficity of elements.
- Style structures such as flexboxes and grids.
- Compare with the initial design to locate discrepancies and resolve them.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

You can implement a separator line between table row elements using a bottom border on the table rows and marking the border-collapse property for the table to collapse to ensure the border can be seen.

```css
table {
	width: 100%;
	border-collapse: collapse;
}

tr {
	border-bottom: 1px solid var(--primary-accent-color);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to utilise the BEM convention for writing css classes in slightly larger projects
